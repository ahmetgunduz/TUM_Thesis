\chapter*{Preface}

This thesis was completed in the chair of Human-Machine  Communications  (MMK) for the Electrical and Computer  Engineering department of TUM, with the supervision of Okan K\"op\"ukl\"u .\\

The department is mainly working on exploring and developing new Artificial Intelligence methods for Speech and Image data.   On the other hand,  Okan is specialized in vision-based action recognition, gesture recognition, and action tracking via Deep Neural Networks methods.\\

Foremost,  I would like to thank  Okan K\"op\"ukl\"u  for giving me the opportunity to explore new areas in Artificial Intelligence and do my master thesis under his direct supervision. His very kind support,  advice, encouragement, and motivation helped me a lot to be able to complete this master thesis work.\\

I would like to thank  Prof.  Dr.-Ing G. Rigoll, the head of the department, who allowed me to carry out this thesis under the MMK chair.\\

In the end, I would like to thank my family, my friends for their support and especially my uncle, Assoc. Prof.  Dr.  Abuzer G\"und\"uz, for his continuous support and encouragements during my whole academic life. I would have never been able to persevere in my education to this level without his rich advice, continuous encouragements and financial support.
